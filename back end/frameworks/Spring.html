<p>
  Spring Framework is a Java platform that provides comprehensive infrastructure
  support for developing Java applications. Spring handles the infrastructure so
  you can focus on your application. Spring enables you to build applications
  from “plain old Java objects” (POJOs) and to apply enterprise services
  non-invasively to POJOs. This capability applies to the Java SE programming
  model and to full and partial Java EE.
